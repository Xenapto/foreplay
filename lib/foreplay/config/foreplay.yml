# Format:
#
# There is a section for each environment that you will deploy to, plus a section that defines global default
# values for all environments, like this:
#
# defaults:
#   ...
# production:
#   ...
# staging:
#   ...
#
# Within each section you can define the server roles for that environment: web, worker, database etc. (the
# names of these roles are up to you). You can also define environment-level defaults that apply to all roles.
# Like this:
#
# production:
#   defaults:
#     ...
#   web:
#     ...
#   worker:
#     ...
#   scheduler:
#     ...
#   database:
#     ...
# staging:
#   defaults:
#     ...
#   web:
#     ...
#   worker:
#     ...
#   scheduler:
#     ...
#   database:
#     ...
#
# Within each role section you can define how the deployment is configured for the servers in that role.
# Some of these values will normally be defined as a default, some will be specific to a particular role.
# The values you can configure are as follows:
#
# value         Normally defined as  Notes
# ------------- -------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
# name:         Global default       App name (if omitted then
#                                    Rails.application.class.parent_name.underscore is used)
# user:         Global default       The username to connect with (must have SSH permissions)
# password:     Global default       The password to use to connect (not necessary if you've set up SSH
#                                    keys - see below)
# keyfile:      Global default       A file containing a private key that allows the named user access
#                                    to the server, or...
# key:          Global default       A private key that allows the named user access to the server
# path:         Global default       An absolute path to deploy the app on each server. %a will be
#                                    translated to the application name. %u will be translated to the
#                                    login user name
# database:     Environment default  The database.yml elements to write to the config folder
#   key: value
# servers: [server1, server2, server3]
#               Role level           Which servers to deploy the app on
# env:          Role level           Contents of the .env file
#   key: value                       Values will go into the .env file as key=value
# foreman:      Role level           Contents of the .foreman file
#   key: value
