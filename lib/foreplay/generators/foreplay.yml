# Format:
#
# defaults:       # global defaults for all environments
#   name:         # app name (if omitted then Rails.application.class.parent_name.underscore is used)
#   servers: [server1, server2, server3] # which servers to deploy the app on
#   user:         # The username to connect with (must have SSH permissions)
#   password:     # The password to use to connect (not necessary if you've set up SSH keys)
#   keyfile:      # A file containing a private key that allows the named user access to the server
#   key:          # A private key that allows the named user access to the server
#   path:         # absolute path to deploy the app on each server. %s will be translated to the application name
#   database:     # the database.yml elements to write to the config folder
#   env:          # contents of the .env file
#     key: value  # will go into the .env file as key=value
#   foreman:      # contents of the .foreman file
#     key: value  # will go into the .foreman file as key: value
# production:     # deployment configuration for the production environment
#   defaults:     # defaults for all roles in this environment (structure same as global defaults)
#   role1:        # settings for the a particular role (e.g. web, worker, etc.) (structure same as global defaults)
#
# Environment:

# Settings for the .env files and .foreman files in specific sections will add to the defaults specified earlier
# .env files will get a RAILS_ENV=environment entry (where environment is as specified here).
# You can override this by adding a different RAILS_ENV setting to this configuration here.
#
# The first instance of the first entry in Procfile that is instantiated by your Foreman concurrency settings will
# be started on port 50100 or 51100 and the external port 80 will be mapped to this port by iptables. You cannot
# configure the ports with this file. As an example, if your Procfile has a web entry on the first line and at
# least one web instance is configured in the .foreman concurrency setting then the first instance of your web
# process will be available on port 80.
#
# Path:
#
# You can use %u in the path. This will be substituted with the user value
# You can use %a in the path. This will be substituted with the app name
# Example:
#
#     user: fred
#     name: myapp
#     path: /home/%u/apps/%a
